</p>Here is what I may do if I were to be made president of America and had better than minimum support in actualizing my aims.</p>

<p>I would abolish the military and police in favor of a modernized approach to civil order that serves everyone rather than capitalists primarily.</p>

<p>I would oversee a mass transition from privatized capitalist ownership to more social, equitable, democratic and fair means of production and deliberation.</p>

<p>We will see the transition towards anarcho communism and political decisions making will be decentralized while becoming much more direct and representative.</p>
